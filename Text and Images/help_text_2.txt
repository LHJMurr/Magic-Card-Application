Adding from a file is as simple as clicking on the 'Add Cards from File' button. There, you can choose the format of the
file from either .txt or a previously made .csv file. Finally, copy the directory of the file into the 'Choose Directory'
box and press 'Add Cards'. This adds all the cards in the file to the app's memory, preparing them to be made into a new file!
