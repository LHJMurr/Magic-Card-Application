This application works in two parts. First, adding cards can be done through the 'Add Cards from File' or 'Add Cards from Scan'
buttons on the homepage. Doing so adds the chosen cards into the app's memory and can be cleared with the 'Clear Loaded Cards'
button or viewed with the 'View Loaded Cards' button. Pressing the 'Create Database' button will take all the card's in
memory and create a .csv file at the location specified in the 'Output Directory' box.
