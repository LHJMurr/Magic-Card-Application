To add cards through the scanning feature, click on the 'Add Cards from Scan' button on the home page. Then, hold the
card up to the webcam such that the titlebox is within the displayed rectangle. Once the scan is complete, the detected
card will be added to the app's memory. If the wrong card is detected simply click the 'Delete Last Card' button to
remove the added card and rescan. If the camera cannot detect the card you can always write the name in the box marked
'Manual Entry' and press 'Add Card'
